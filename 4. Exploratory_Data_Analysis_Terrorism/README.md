# Terrorism Dataset Analysis with Tableau

This repository contains a Tableau project focused on analyzing a dataset related to terrorism incidents. The dataset provides detailed information about various aspects of terrorist incidents, such as date, location, attack type, target type, and more.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Identify Hot Zones of Terrorism:**
   - Utilize Tableau to visualize the geographical distribution of terrorist incidents and pinpoint regions with the highest frequency of occurrences.

2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Security Insights:**
   - Conduct in-depth analysis of the dataset to derive security-related insights, including attack types, target types, success rates, and more.

Used Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **EDA Tool**: Tableau
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Dataset Source**: [Global Torrorism on Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/global-terrorism)
- **Tableau**: [Torrorism_Analysis on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/Terrorism_Analysis_16953067095590/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)



## Dataset Description

The original dataset contained a comprehensive set of 135 columns, which were cleaned and refined to 38 columns for analysis. These columns encompass a wide range of information related to terrorism incidents, including details about the date, location, attack characteristics, and various attributes associated with the incidents.

For a detailed overview of the available columns and their meanings, it is recommended to refer to the dataset folder which contains both datasets (Original, and Cleaned), or refer to the dataset source <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/global-terrorism'> here


## Tableau Visualizations

The Tableau project consists of various visualizations to achieve the project objectives:

1. **Heat Map of Terrorist Incidents:**
   - Visualizes the concentration of incidents on a geographical map, highlighting regions with higher incident frequencies.

2. **Region-wise Incident Count:**
   - Displays the count of incidents for each region, providing an overview of regions with the highest number of incidents.

3. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Tracks the trend of terrorist incidents over time, enabling the identification of temporal patterns.
