# Student Score Prediction - Supervised ML

### This is The 1st Task in The Internship of The Sparks Foundation in Data Science

#### The task is predicttion of students scores using Linear Regression Algorithm.

The main process is training the model on the data of student scores to make a model can predict any student score based on study time in hours.
The dataset contains two main columns:
- Hours: Which represent the student study time in hours.
- Scores: Which represent the student grade.

### The model has walk through these steps:
- Importing the necessary libraries ~ (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn...).
- Some EDA ~ (The Distribution of Scores, Regression Plot...).
- Initialize the model for the training process ~ (Deviding and Splitting the data, fitting the LinearRegression model...).
- Starting the prediction process.
- Comparing tThe actual label with the model predicted label.
- Testing the model on new values.
- Model Evaluating.
