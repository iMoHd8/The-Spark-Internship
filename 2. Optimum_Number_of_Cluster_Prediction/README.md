# Prediction Using Unsupervised ML with K-Means
The 2nd Task in The Internship of The Sparks Foundation in Data Science. This project demonstrates the application of the KMeans clustering algorithm to the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features of iris flowers from three different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. KMeans clustering is used to group similar iris flowers based on their feature measurements. The Goal is To Predict The Optimum Number of Cluster to Use in The Model Training

> ## Project Overview

- **Clustering Algorithm**: KMeans
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Dataset Source**: [Iris.csv on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view)

> ## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Prediction_Using_Unsupervised_ML.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for loading the dataset, performing KMeans clustering, and visualizing the results.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.
- `Iris.csv`: This is The Used Iris Dataset.

> ## Results

The KMeans clustering algorithm successfully groups the Iris dataset into clusters based on their feature measurements. The clusters are visualized in the notebook using different colors, and the centroids of each cluster are marked in black. The legend in the plot indicates which cluster corresponds to each Iris species:

- Red points represent the 'Iris-setosa' cluster.
- Blue points represent the 'Iris-versicolor' cluster.
- Green points represent the 'Iris-virginica' cluster.

The project's Jupyter Notebook (`Prediction_Using_Unsupervised_ML.ipynb`) provides a detailed view of the clustering process and visualization of the results.
